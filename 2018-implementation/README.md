# chrome-dino 2018 version

I took an AI class in 2018 and was introduced to the subject for the first time. For a final project for the class, I hacked together a model that played chrome://dino better than I could by doing some image processing and data augmentation. Hindsight is 20/20; a supervised learning model was not at all the optimal approach, but much was learned.

- Used Tensorflow and a CNN to predict output for a little model that plays the game "Chrome Dino."
- Wrote a simple python program to capture input and build a training set based on my own input
- Wrote a simple python program to train the model
- Wrote a simple python program to apply the model and play the game
- Sloppy and manual, but learned a lot.
