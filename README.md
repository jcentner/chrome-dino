# chrome-dino

## 2018 Version
- Used Tensorflow and a CNN to predict output for a little model that plays the game "Chrome Dino."
- Wrote a simple python program to capture input and build a training set based on my own input
- Wrote a simple python program to train the model
- Wrote a simple python program to apply the model and play the game
- Sloppy and manual, but learned a lot.

On the TODO list: Reinvent this with a GAN and better written
